# History

Started circa 1997, as the LRP ("Linux Router Project"). Meant to be a
fast minimal functional linux for routers. Over time routers part
became less relevant, but the minimal functionalism remained.

Then came docker, and people realized that Alpine (what it had come to
be called by now) was the perfect fit.

2025, I connected the dots together: Alpine was the BSD I need.

> It made me feel something, for which I don't have yet a word for, to
  realize that all these projects are now 30-ish years old.
