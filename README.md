(Archived) Notes on my workstation, Mars.

In [10 distros in 10 days](https://mnvr.in/10-distros/), I wandered around in
the Linux distro landscape and found **Alpine Linux**, the BSD I wanted but
forward looking.

These here were are some notes I took as I was exploring it for the first time.

They're not updated anymore, and were possibly misinformed to begin with, but
still I'll leave them around for people like me who like time travelling into
the past by reading what Denver9 was doing that hot summer Sunday afternoon to
the comforting whirr of ceiling fans.
